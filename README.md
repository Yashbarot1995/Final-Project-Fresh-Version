# Final Project Fresh Version
 Layers with mass data with distance measurement tool
 # Final-Project
Two sets of mass data are shown as two separate layers. They can be switched on/off and can be shown together.
The data were first collected in excel. Then it was converted to csv file with necessary formatting. Then it was converted online from csv to geojson.
The geojson was uploaded by using map.addSource() function.
Earlier an attempt to create the same results using json files had failed.
The biggest hurdle was to convert the data into readable format.
